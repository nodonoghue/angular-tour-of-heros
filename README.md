# AngularTourOfHeros

My walkthrough of the Tour of Heros tutorial, still in progress, from [angular.io](https://angular.io/tutorial)
Nothing special, learning the basics after being thrown in head first into an Angular project professionally.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.
